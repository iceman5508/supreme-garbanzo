##__Work Just Got Social!__##

_Work Juts Got Social!_ is the name of a the project my team and I created last year to aid many orginzations who wanted to create a more social and open atmosphere around the work place. The application that was created from this project is something we call a Social Content Management System (SCMS). It has many of the features of social netwoek applications including profile pages, direct messaging and a comment system. However, there is no friend system nor is there a private image management system. Since the application is geared more towrads businesses, images are company related and every member can contact any other user that has an account. 


##__User Stories__##

_Mark Barber:_ As a small business owner, I wanted a way to connect with all of my employees as well as keep them connected to each other and the company. Sure there is facebook and content management systems already built on the web. However, facebook, tends to get messy especially at tims when it reveals the personal lives of it user. As far as other content management systems go, they seemed too rigid. I want my employees to still get the feel of a social network while still managing serious aspects as it relates to the business online. 

_Santa, Just Santa:_ As a proud owner of a..umm..world recgonized organization, I wanted a way to assign task to my workers with a given time frame and be able to check if that work has been done without the other million employees knowing what that person's task was. Additionally, I want to be able use some tyoe of login timestamp as a marker for when my workers clock in for work and clock out. Lastly, I simply want to be able to connect with my users without invading their private lives or get a fully picture of their lives through social media. 

_Scotty Dog:_ I currently work at a college where the seniors produce a 6 month long project called an Independent Study (I.S.).
I want to be able to have all student have their own personal page, so to speak, and upload their project there. Once uploaded I want that work to then be organized by department. This way any student can simply go to a department page and get any I.S project or they can click on a specific student's page and get their specific project.
