##The Virtual St Paul’s Cathedral Project


##Project Overview
 After being destroyed in the great London fire of 1666, pre-fire St. Paul’s Cathedral is brought back to life by John N. Wall, Ben Crystal and many other contributors through architectural modeling and acoustic simulation. The Virtual Paul's Cross Project, grants visitors to the site the ability to explore preaching as it would have been experienced in early modern London. Through the project we can gain full auditory information about what it must have been like to be at the historic Cathedral in real-time as John Donne delivered his gunpowder day (Guy Fawkes Day for you V for vendetta fans) on Tuesday, November 5, 1622. Thanks to preserved records and manuscripts, the pre-Fire St. Paul's Cathedral that history lost can now be explored. The modeling system does well to integrate the physical traces of these documents with images of the cathedral and its surroundings to create a visual model of the Cathedral and its churchyard. According to the project’s website:
 
The Virtual St Paul’s Cathedral Project will enable us to experience worship and preaching at St Paul’s Cathedral and in Paul’s Churchyard as events that unfold over time and on particular occasions in London in the early seventeenth century.
This project pushes new bounds in the intersection between history and technology as we are given a virtual environment that allows us to experience (as close an approximation as we can create) events of the past given the technology we have today. 


##Concept & Content

###The concept:
Based on my experience with the site as well as examining other user experiences, the concept of the project is very clear. To spell out this concept it is “to allow users to experience worship and preaching at St Paul’s Cathedral and in Paul’s Churchyard”. The vast array of references used such as, a full scale measurement of the Cathedral’s foundation in London aided in the development of a virtual environment that closely resembles the location described by the manuscripts, historical paintings and documents used. Additionally, the delivery of John Donne’s sermon captures preacher in terms of the rhetoric and the preaching style he had in 1622. This in itself speaks volumes as to the meticulous attention to historical detail and accuracy in the development of the concept. 

###The content: 
What has been derived from the initial concept is a digital model that aims to restore the multisensory (visual and audio) experiences of the past in real-time that prior to this project had only been preserved in words and paintings. The project not only brings the event of the past to life, but also the environment. This includes the weather, crowd size, social and physical environment. Then there is the detail to the sermon itself, which has been captured in detail as small as the order of service. Additionally, due to the life surrounding the models produced by the project the volume and intensity of the sermon changes based on where the visitor is in the virtual environment.

However, the content is not without its cons. While the project attempt to represent reality and historical accuracy as close as possible. The auditory data at best can be said to be approximation of words spoken and heard. In terms of the environment itself, it givens promotes an illusion of authenticity of the entire model and environment. This is problematic as based on the resource used to develop the environment; I find that while most of the model is represented accurately, some of it are mere approximations. Finally, the biggest flaw I find in the project is that the historical event the entire project is centered around did not happen, well not exactly. Historically speaking, on November 5th, 1622 in London the weather would not have allowed for there to have been an outdoor sermon. In fact according to the sermon itself the entire event was actually held indoors. This once again speaks to the illusion of authenticity provided by the project as all the auditory data being represented could not have possibly occurred in the manner that it is being presented.

##Design & Technique

###The Design:
The design of the project seamlessly merges concept and content with functionality. Information is easily accessible and carefully presented for users. However, the ease of access does not eliminate challenge and exploration as the environment of the project provides a sense of dynamics in terms of interaction between user and content. 

Where the project fall short, perhaps a lot more than short, it is a major oversight in my opinion; is in its delivery of the project to different platforms. My above statement of the design being seamlessly presented only holds true if the mode of interaction is a pc , desktop computer or laptop with a screen size of around 7 inches or more (trust me I personally tested this). Furthermore, the project is rendered completely fruitless as no attempts were made to scale the project base on the user’s display device, which in turn breaks the emersion of the environment being presented. Also this project was first developed in 2012 and then revisited in 2014. So to have a site that was developed between 2012-2014 and it not be mobile compatible is actually rare in this day and age. Especially considering the push/trend of responsive web design began in 2010.  

###The Technique:
There is nothing more to say about the technique that can do justice to the work done. Simply the techniques used must have been done by super advanced, human history loving space aliens. Currently I am unable to even begin to explain how the same auditory data can be projected differently based on where on is in a sketched modeled environment. It is simply amazing; I greatly applaud the audio engineers!  
  
##Collaboration & Documentation
This is perhaps the strongest point of the project. The documentation is without question flawless. There is no portion of this project that could have been done without proper documentation. Additionally, in terms of collaboration, I believe it says a lot to the dedication of the development team to have the st Paul's Cathedral Archaeologist be the pain source of historical and environmental data. 
  
The project allows for collaboration from multiple fields of study as the environment in some ways restores not only a piece of lost history, but immerses users within the environment, culture, feel of the event as well as time in history. 

###Final Thoughts:
Overall the Virtual St Paul’s Cathedral Project does a great job of bring to life an abstract idea and making an immersive, welcoming environment for personal enjoyment and historical references.
