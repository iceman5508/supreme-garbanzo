##### Homework #1 - Reading Response
##### Due 1-25-2016 



#####&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blog post ___What most young programmers need to learn___ ,__Joost van Dongen__ identifies self discipline as the main thing needed by young developers. However, when he says self discipline, he means the discipline to always write the clearest code, the discipline to refactor code, and the discipline to remove unused codeand add comments. While I can agree with self discipline is a key skill that young programmers need to learn where we differ is in how we define self discipline. 

#####&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For myself as a young developer, one of th thing i find the most challenging is planning ot my code  andor project prior to hacking away on a computer. Naturally, I have found that when I have planned out my code, my development time is not only faster, but the fine code is vastly cleaner than it would have been if I had not planned it out. This hold true for every developer that I have ever worked with as well. 

#####&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not to say that the concerns voiced by __Joost van Dongen__ is not valid, rather, the cocerns he presented in his blog are direct results of failure to plan. I belive the more time a developer spends thinking about and planning out the program on paper, the less time they will be spend on a computer debugging and cleaning!
